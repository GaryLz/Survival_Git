- fix bugs 

when you get a task from your boss to fix a bug,
however, your work at hand still need one more day,
you can't commit and stop your work right away,
and go fixing another bug.

- how do you do?
- Luckily, git leaves us another way out.
cmd---
	git stash
this can save up your current work, keeps your process of task.
let you free of work at hand, and go focus on another rushy task.

after making up for the bug,
you can come back and continue your work.

--git stash list
	--to see your recent backup

-- two ways of restoration

--1. includes two steps
-git stash apply --stash@{}
-git stash drop --stash@{} /to delete related backup

--2. one step is enough
-git stash pop. /pop up
