you had known one mode of merging,
let me introduce another one.

	merge --no-ff    (forbid Fast-forward)
	
need to mention that,
the cmd--
	git --no-ff -m "merge without ff"
the process includes two, one for merge, the other for a new commit.


========================

<note> here,

Gernally, the branch "master" is used to release a new version,
in other words, it's really stable, compared with other branches.


i.e.
when releasing a 1.0-version, 
you need to merge related branches with the mojor branch-"master".

when co-coding in a project with colleagues or co-workers,
you guys all work based on a branch like "dev",
and everyone all have their own branch,
to commit your contributions.
In the end, you could easily integrate into a final release on the branch "master".
