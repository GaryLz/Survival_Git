to tag while releasing a new version of project

why should we do that?
'cause it's like taking a screenshot while ready for release,
it can be much easier to find exactly the version we want.


```
git branch
*dev

git checkout master

--to list all of tags
git tag
--

--what if forgeting to tag a should-to-be-tagged files

git log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit

--to check the commit_id in history of commits
e.g. 6224937

git tag v0.9 6224937

$ git tag
v0.9
v1.0

the sequence of tag list, is based on alphabetical rules.

```
-a tag-name -m --message

git tag -a v0.1 -m "version 0.1 released" 3628164
git show v0.1

```

what if make a false tag,
--you could delete it--
git tag -d v0.1

because the tags are saved up in the local,
it can't push them automatically to the remote,
so, you can delete the wrong tags in the local.


```
git push origin <tagname>
```
only push the expected tag to the remote

======
what if we push the wrong to the remote,
1. delete it in the local
git tag -d v0.9
2. delete it from the remote
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.9
======
