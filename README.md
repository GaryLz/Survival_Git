### Survivial-Git

---

**Here is a few study notes about a booked called *Survival Git*.**

Upload those files onto GitHub, in case of data loss one day. 

Also out of recording my learning footprints on linux.

> One of drawbacks, is .txt file of those notes. Hope someday I could transform them into .md or PDF files fo a better reading experience.

I'll add some extra notes in the future.
