--note here--

1. git push origin branch-name
to commit your local commits

2. if commits fail, that's because the remote has been updated,
so try, git pull, to merge.

3. if conficts exit while merging, first deal with it and commit to the local.

4. without conflict, push succeeds after tying "git push origin branch-name"


after git pull, notify  

git remote -v
to see info about the remote

to set up tracking information
git branch --set-upstream branch-name origin/branch-name
